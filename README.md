# Stone-Paper-Scissors-using-Spring-Boot
This Stone-Paper-Scissors web application, built using Spring Boot, allows users to play the classic game against the computer. The user-friendly interface enables players to select their move (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) through an HTML form. Once the user submits their choice, the Spring Boot backend processes the input, randomly generates the computer's move, and determines the winner based on traditional game rules. The results, including both the player’s and computer’s choices along with the outcome, are then displayed on the screen. Designed with a stateless approach, each round of the game operates independently, enhancing user experience. The application employs RESTful APIs for efficient request and response handling, making it easy to integrate and extend its functionality.
